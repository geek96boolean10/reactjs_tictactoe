This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Starting with a bare minimum amount of knowledge about front-end web development, I took this opportunity to pick up not one, not two, but three things at once: CSS, Javascript, and React.js. After reading up on documentation, taking a few online tests, and messing around in sandboxes, this is my first React project. 

I hope to continually add new apps and demos to this as I learn more about using React, Javascript, and APIs.

Please allow a few moments while the container is started.
