This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Starting with a bare minimum amount of knowledge about front-end web development, I took this opportunity to pick up not one, not two, but three things at once: CSS, Javascript, and React.js. After reading up on documentation, taking a few online tests, and messing around in sandboxes, this is my first React project. 

After running <code>npm start</code> in the directory, visiting <code>localhost:3000</code> will show a simple Tic-Tac-Toe grid. 

As of the initial upload, game evaluation has not been added yet. Refreshing the page resets the game. There is substantial debug material printed in the console as I validate my game logic and learn to work with stateless components.

Thanks for visiting!
